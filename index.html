      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>I'm cultivating skills in order to recognize a career      in web and software development. I've climed the ladder of a landscaping career from the bottom as a general laborer to      ultimately an irrigation companies general manager before deciding to pursue this career. Many times I was faced with      difficult issues to overcome for clients and I've found well written software and systems have made my life much easier.      Which eventually led me to discover a passion for being able to create these solutions myself to help shape industries.      I greatly look forward to working with my peers in order to develope future pillars of software. </p>
